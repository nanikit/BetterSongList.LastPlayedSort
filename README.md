Beat saber mod adding last played date sort feature to [BetterSongList](https://github.com/kinsi55/BeatSaber_BetterSongList). This requires BetterSongList.

## Installation

Use [mod assistant](https://github.com/Assistant/ModAssistant/releases/latest). I'll support that.

If it's not available or new features is added later, download [the latest release](https://github.com/nanikit/BetterSort/releases/latest).

## Usage

Just click left-bottom sort button in song select scene, and select 'Last played'.

## Q&A

- Q: Just installed, it doesn't sort at all.<br />
  A: After installation there's no play history. So play first.

- Q: Reverse sort not work.<br />
  A: I didn't support it intentionally. Currently BetterSongList doesn't remember sort direction of each sorter, it confused me.
